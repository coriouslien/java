In Java, an unchecked exception is a type of exception that does not need to be declared in a 
method's throws clause or explicitly caught in a try-catch block for the code to compile. 
These exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException or Error.
Unchecked exceptions typically represent programming errors or unexpected conditions that are 
not easily recoverable programmatically. They are often indicative of a bug in the code that needs 
to be fixed, rather than an anticipated error that should be handled at runtime.

Common examples of unchecked exceptions include:
NullPointerException: Occurs when attempting to use a null reference as if it were an object.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Occurs when trying to access an array element at an invalid index.
ArithmeticException: Occurs in cases like division by zero.
ClassCastException: Occurs when attempting to cast an object to a type it is not compatible with.
While you are not forced to handle unchecked exceptions, you can still catch them using try-catch
blocks if necessary, for example, to log the error or perform some cleanup before the program
terminates. However, the general recommendation is to fix the underlying programming error that 
leads to an unchecked exception rather than simply catching it.
