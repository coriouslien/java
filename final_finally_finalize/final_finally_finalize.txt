The keywords final, finally, and the method finalize() (now deprecated) serve entirely different 
purposes related to immutability and control, exception handling cleanup, and garbage collection 
cleanup, respectively. 

final: Used for constants, preventing method overriding, or preventing class inheritance.
finally: A block in exception handling that always executes.
finalize: A garbage collector method, though try-with-resources is generally preferred.

The keywords final, finally, and finalize in Java are often confused due to their similar names, but they serve three completely different and unrelated purposes within the language.

Here is a breakdown of each keyword, their roles, and a complete code example.

🔑 1. final (Modifier for Immutability and Prevention)
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used to define something that cannot be changed or
overridden. Its primary purpose is to ensure immutability and prevent unwanted extension or
modification.

Context       Purpose of final                         Example
Variable	    Makes the variable a constant.           Its value can only be assigned once.
Method	      Prevents subclassing from overriding     public final void connect() { ... }
              the method.
Class	        Prevents the class from being            public final class String { ... }
              extended (subclassed). Used to ensure 
              security and immutability.
