The existence of primitive data types is the primary reason Java is considered an object-oriented language with procedural elements, rather than a purely or "100%" object-oriented language.

🚫 The Barrier: Java Primitive Data Types
A purely object-oriented (OO) language, like Smalltalk, treats everything as an object, inheriting from a base class and supporting polymorphism. Java fails this test because of its eight primitive types:

char

byte

float

int

boolean

short

double

long

Why Primitives Break Pure OO
No Inheritance: Primitives do not inherit from java.lang.Object (the root of all Java classes).

No Polymorphism: You cannot use a primitive type to reference an object of a different type, nor can you override behavior.

No Methods: Primitives do not have methods (e.g., you cannot call 5.toString() in Java).

Stored by Value: Primitives are stored directly on the stack (or within an object's memory block),
whereas objects are stored on the heap and accessed via references.

💻 Code Examples Demonstrating the Difference
The following examples highlight the functional and conceptual differences between the primitive 
int and its corresponding wrapper object, Integer.

Example 1: Methods and Nullability
Objects support methods and can be null; primitives do not.
