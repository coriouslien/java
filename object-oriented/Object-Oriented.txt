The existence of primitive data types is the primary reason Java is considered an object-oriented language with procedural elements, rather than a purely or "100%" object-oriented language.

🚫 The Barrier: Java Primitive Data Types
A purely object-oriented (OO) language, like Smalltalk, treats everything as an object, inheriting from a base class and supporting polymorphism. Java fails this test because of its eight primitive types:

char

byte

float

int

boolean

short

double

long

Why Primitives Break Pure OO
No Inheritance: Primitives do not inherit from java.lang.Object (the root of all Java classes).

No Polymorphism: You cannot use a primitive type to reference an object of a different type, nor can you override behavior.

No Methods: Primitives do not have methods (e.g., you cannot call 5.toString() in Java).

Stored by Value: Primitives are stored directly on the stack (or within an object's memory block),
whereas objects are stored on the heap and accessed via references.

Autoboxing and Unboxing (Java's Bridge)
To make programming easier, Java introduced autoboxing (automatically converting a primitive 
to its wrapper object) and unboxing (converting a wrapper object back to its primitive).
