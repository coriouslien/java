Java is not considered a purely object-oriented language because it incorporates eight primitive 
data types (boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double) that are not objects. 
In a purely object-oriented language, every data type would be an object capable of polymorphism,
inheritance, and having associated methods. Java's primitives lack these object-oriented features. 
To mitigate this, Java provides wrapper classes for each primitive type (e.g., Integer for int,
Boolean for boolean), which are full objects. Java also introduced autoboxing and unboxing to
automatically convert between primitives and their corresponding wrapper objects, making the 
language feel more object-oriented in practice. 
Below are complete examples illustrating the difference between a primitive type and an object
(specifically a wrapper class object).

Key Differences Illustrated by the Code:
Methods: You cannot use the dot operator (.) on primitiveInt to access methods like toString(). 
You can on objectInt.
Nullability: Integer can be assigned the value null, representing the absence of an object. The
primitive int cannot; it must always have a value, even if it's the default 0.
Behavior: Primitives store raw values efficiently in the stack, while objects are full instances 
of a class, stored in the heap, possessing state and behavior (methods). 


The existence of primitive data types is the primary reason Java is considered an 
object-oriented language with procedural elements, rather than a purely or "100%" 
object-oriented language.

🚫 The Barrier: Java Primitive Data Types
A purely object-oriented (OO) language, like Smalltalk, treats everything as an object, 
inheriting from a base class and supporting polymorphism. Java fails this test because of its 
eight primitive types:

char

byte

float

int

boolean

short

double

long

Why Primitives Break Pure OO
No Inheritance: Primitives do not inherit from java.lang.Object (the root of all Java classes).

No Polymorphism: You cannot use a primitive type to reference an object of a different type, nor can you override behavior.

No Methods: Primitives do not have methods (e.g., you cannot call 5.toString() in Java).

Stored by Value: Primitives are stored directly on the stack (or within an object's memory block),
whereas objects are stored on the heap and accessed via references.

Autoboxing and Unboxing (Java's Bridge)
To make programming easier, Java introduced autoboxing (automatically converting a primitive 
to its wrapper object) and unboxing (converting a wrapper object back to its primitive).
