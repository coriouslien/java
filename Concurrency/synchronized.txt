The Java synchronized keyword is the fundamental mechanism for achieving thread safety by 
enforcing mutual exclusion and guaranteeing memory visibility between threads.
🔒 1. The synchronized Keyword The synchronized keyword uses an object's intrinsic lock 
(or monitor lock) to protect shared data and critical sections of code. 
A. Mutual Exclusion Only one thread can hold a lock at any given time. When a thread enters 
a synchronized block or method, it must acquire the lock. If the lock is already held by 
another thread, the new thread is blocked (waits) until the lock is released.
B. Memory Visibility The synchronized mechanism ensures a happens-before relationship. 
This means: When a thread releases a lock, all its writes to shared variables become visible 
to other threads. When another thread acquires the same lock, it sees the latest written 
values of those shared variables.
C. Usage The keyword can be applied in two main ways: 
Usage Type          Lock Acquired                      Description
Instance Method	    The lock of the current object	   public synchronized void method() { ... }
                    instance (this).	

Static Method	      The lock of the Class object       public static synchronized void method() { ... }
                    (ClassName.class).	

Synchronized Block	The lock of the object             synchronized (lockObject) { ... } 
                    specified in parentheses.          (Most flexible)
