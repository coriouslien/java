The synchronized keyword in Java is a fundamental mechanism for achieving thread safety by 
controlling access to shared resources. It ensures that only one thread can execute a critical 
section of code at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
How synchronized Works:
When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it acquires a lock (monitor) associated 
with the object or class. Other threads attempting to enter the same synchronized block or method 
on the same object (or class, for static methods) will be blocked until the first thread releases 
the lock.
Limitations of synchronized:
Lack of Flexibility: synchronized provides a basic, all-or-nothing locking mechanism. It doesn't 
offer fine-grained control over lock acquisition and release.
No Timeout Mechanism: A thread waiting for a synchronized lock can be blocked indefinitely if the 
lock-holding thread never releases it.
No tryLock() Capability: There's no built-in way to attempt to acquire a lock without blocking, 
which can be useful in scenarios where you want to perform alternative actions if the lock is
unavailable.
Single Condition Variable: synchronized is coupled with wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods 
of Object, which only provide a single waiting condition for a given object.
Alternative Approaches to Thread Safety:
Lock Interface (e.g., ReentrantLock):
The java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface offers more flexible and advanced locking mechanisms
than synchronized. 
ReentrantLock allows for:
Explicit lock acquisition (lock()) and release (unlock()).
tryLock() for non-blocking lock attempts.
tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) for timed lock attempts.
Multiple Condition objects for finer-grained waiting and notification.

The Java synchronized keyword is the fundamental mechanism for achieving thread safety by 
enforcing mutual exclusion and guaranteeing memory visibility between threads.
🔒 1. The synchronized Keyword The synchronized keyword uses an object's intrinsic lock 
(or monitor lock) to protect shared data and critical sections of code. 
A. Mutual Exclusion Only one thread can hold a lock at any given time. When a thread enters 
a synchronized block or method, it must acquire the lock. If the lock is already held by 
another thread, the new thread is blocked (waits) until the lock is released.
B. Memory Visibility The synchronized mechanism ensures a happens-before relationship. 
This means: When a thread releases a lock, all its writes to shared variables become visible 
to other threads. When another thread acquires the same lock, it sees the latest written 
values of those shared variables.
C. Usage The keyword can be applied in two main ways: 
Usage Type          Lock Acquired                      Description
Instance Method	    The lock of the current object	   public synchronized void method() { ... }
                    instance (this).	

Static Method	      The lock of the Class object       public static synchronized void method() { ... }
                    (ClassName.class).	

Synchronized Block	The lock of the object             synchronized (lockObject) { ... } 
                    specified in parentheses.          (Most flexible)
