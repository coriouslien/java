The difference between an abstract class and an interface is a foundational concept in Java 
object-oriented programming. Although both are used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism, 
they serve distinct purposes and have evolved significantly over Java's history (especially since Java 8).Here is a detailed breakdown of their differences, roles, and implementation rules.

Inheritance	             Single Inheritance Only.      Multiple Inheritance Allowed.

Methods	                 Can have abstract (no body)   Until Java 8, methods were all implicitly
                         and concrete (implemented)    public abstract. Now, they can have
                         methods.                      default and static methods with bodies,
                                                       and private methods. 
Fields/Variables	       Can have any type of          Fields are implicitly public static final

Constructor	             Can have constructors.        Cannot have constructors.

Evolution                Difficult to evolve;          Easier to evolve since Java 8, as new methods
                         adding a new abstract         can be added with default implementations.
