An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and non-public members, 
while an interface primarily defines functionality and has implicitly public members. 
A class can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

The main difference is that an abstract class is used for related classes that share a common 
base, state, and partial implementation (an "is-a" relationship), while an interface defines a contract for any class to follow, focusing solely on shared behavior without dictating 
implementation or state (a "can-do" or "has-a" ability). 
Key Differences
Abstract classes and interfaces differ in several key areas. A class can extend only one abstract
class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. Abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces can have abstract, default, and static methods. Fields in abstract
classes can be of various types, but interface fields must be public static final constants. 
Abstract classes can have constructors, but interfaces cannot. Access modifiers vary in 
abstract classes, but interface methods are implicitly public, and fields are implicitly public 
static final. Abstract classes are used to share code and state among related classes, 
whereas interfaces define a behavior contract for unrelated classes

The difference between an abstract class and an interface is a foundational concept in Java 
object-oriented programming. Although both are used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism, 
they serve distinct purposes and have evolved significantly over Java's history (especially since Java 8).Here is a detailed breakdown of their differences, roles, and implementation rules.
