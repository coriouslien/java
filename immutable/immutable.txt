An immutable class in Java is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. 
Once an object is constructed, its internal state (its data) remains constant for the entire 
lifetime of the object.

A classic example of an immutable class in the Java Standard Library is java.lang.String. 
When you "change" a String, you aren't modifying the existing memory; you are actually creating 
a brand-new String object.

🛠️ The 5 Rules for Creating an Immutable Class
To ensure a class is truly immutable, you must follow these specific design steps:

Declare the class as final: This prevents other classes from subclassing it and potentially 
overriding methods to make them mutable.

Make all fields private and final:

private prevents direct access.

final ensures the field is initialized only once (in the constructor).

Do not provide "Setter" methods: There should be no methods that change the value of fields.

Initialize all fields via the Constructor: This is the only place where the state is set.

Perform Defensive Copying: If the class contains references to mutable objects (like a List or 
a Date), you must copy those objects during construction and when returning them from getter methods.

🌟 Why use Immutable Classes?
Thread Safety: Since the state never changes, multiple threads can access the object simultaneously
without any risk of data corruption or race conditions.

Security: They provide a guarantee that sensitive data (like a URL or a password stored in a String) won't be altered unexpectedly.

Caching and Reuse: You can safely cache immutable objects or use them as keys in a HashMap 
because their hashCode will never change.
