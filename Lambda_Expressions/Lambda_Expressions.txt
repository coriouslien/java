A lambda expression provides a concise way to implement a functional interface (an interface with
exactly one abstract method). They allow you to treat functionality as a method argument or code 
as data.

Syntax: (parameters) -> { body }

Optional<T> (Java 8)
Optional is a container object used to represent a value that may or may not be present. Its 
primary goal is to address the millions of dollars lost to NullPointerException by forcing 
the programmer to explicitly think about the absence of a value.

Usage: Instead of returning null, a method returns an Optional. The caller must then use
methods like isPresent(), orElse(), or map() to safely handle the potential absence of a
value.
