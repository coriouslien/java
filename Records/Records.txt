Java Records, introduced as a standard feature in Java 16, are a special type of class designed
specifically to act as "transparent holders for immutable data." They dramatically simplify 
the creation of immutable classes by eliminating nearly all the boilerplate code.

🚀 How Records Simplify Immutability
In a traditional immutable class, you have to manually write the fields, constructor, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString(). A Record does all of this automatically in a single line of code.

How Records Map to the "5 Rules"
Records handle most of the immutability requirements by default:

Implicitly final: Records cannot be extended by other classes.

Implicitly private final fields: The components you list in the record header are automatically
created as private final fields.

No Setters: Records do not generate setters. They only generate "accessor" methods (e.g., id() 
instead of getId()).

Automatic Constructor: A "Canonical Constructor" is generated that initializes all fields.

Bonus - Identity Methods: equals(), hashCode(), and toString() are automatically implemented based 
on the data components.
