The fundamental difference between the == operator and the .equals() method in Java lies in 
what they are comparing: references versus content. 

1. The == Operator (Reference Comparison) 
The == operator compares the memory addresses of the objects being referenced. It returns true 
only if both variables point to the exact same object instance in memory. 

2. The .equals() Method (Content Comparison)
The .equals() method is designed to compare the actual values or contents of two objects. 
Default Behavior (Not Overridden)
By default, the equals() method inherited from the base Object class simply performs the exact 
same reference comparison as ==. 

The core difference between the == operator and the .equals() method in Java. This distinction is
fundamental to understanding how objects are compared in the language.
Here is a detailed explanation and complete code examples illustrating these concepts:
⚖️ == vs. .equals()
Feature                == Operator                       .equals() Method
Purpose	               Reference Comparison (Identity)	 Content Comparison (Value)

Mechanism	             Compares the memory addresses     Compares the actual data inside two objects.
                       (pointers) of two objects.	

Applicability	         Always works. For primitives      Only works on objects. Behavior is defined by
                       (like int), it compares values.   the class implementation.
                       For objects, it compares 
                       references.

Default Behavior       For objects, the default behavior 
                       inherited from java.lang.Object 
                      is the same as == 
                      (i.e., it compares references).

Customization         Cannot be overridden.               Can and should be overridden in custom
                                                          classes to define meaningful equality.
