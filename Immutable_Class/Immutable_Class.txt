An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. 
The String class is a classic example. To create an immutable class, you must ensure all fields 
are final and private, and that no methods allow modification of the object's state.





An immutable class in Java is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. 
Once an object is constructed, its internal state remains fixed throughout its lifetime.

This design pattern is highly desirable in programming, especially in concurrent environments, 
because it simplifies thread safety and improves code predictability.

🔒 Key Rules for Creating an Immutable Class
To ensure a class is truly immutable, it must adhere to the following five rules:

Declare the class as final: This prevents the class from being extended (subclassed). 
Subclassing could allow a mutable child class to violate the immutability contract.

Declare all fields as private and final:

private restricts direct external access.

final ensures the field's value can only be initialized once (either in the declaration or the
constructor).

Do not provide setter methods: This is the direct way to ensure the object's state cannot be 
changed after construction.

Make the constructor the only way to initialize the state: All necessary state must be provided 
when the object is created.

Defensive Copying of Mutable Objects: If the class holds references to mutable objects (like Date 
or a List), you must:

In the constructor: Create a deep copy of the passed-in mutable object and store the copy.

In getter methods: Return a deep copy of the mutable object, not the original reference. 
(This prevents external code from modifying the internal state via the returned reference.)
