An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. 
The String class is a classic example. To create an immutable class, you must ensure all fields 
are final and private, and that no methods allow modification of the object's state.

An immutable class in Java is a class whose objects cannot be modified after they are created. 
Once an object is instantiated, its internal state remains constant throughout its lifecycle, 
which makes the class inherently thread-safe and less prone to bugs. The String class is the 
most common example of an immutable class in Java. 
To create a custom immutable class in Java, you must adhere to several strict design rules: 
Declare the class as final: This prevents other classes from extending it and potentially 
overriding methods to introduce mutable behavior.
Make all fields private and final: This ensures fields are initialized only once in the 
constructor and cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class.
Do not provide setter methods: The only way to set the values is via the constructor.
Use a parameterized constructor: Initialize all fields during object creation.
Perform defensive copying for mutable fields: If your class contains references to mutable 
objects (like Date or List), the constructor and getter methods must use deep copies (clones) 
to prevent external code from modifying the internal state. 



An immutable class in Java is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. 
Once an object is constructed, its internal state remains fixed throughout its lifetime.

This design pattern is highly desirable in programming, especially in concurrent environments, 
because it simplifies thread safety and improves code predictability.

🔒 Key Rules for Creating an Immutable Class
To ensure a class is truly immutable, it must adhere to the following five rules:

Declare the class as final: This prevents the class from being extended (subclassed). 
Subclassing could allow a mutable child class to violate the immutability contract.

Declare all fields as private and final:

private restricts direct external access.

final ensures the field's value can only be initialized once (either in the declaration or the
constructor).

Do not provide setter methods: This is the direct way to ensure the object's state cannot be 
changed after construction.

Make the constructor the only way to initialize the state: All necessary state must be provided 
when the object is created.

Defensive Copying of Mutable Objects: If the class holds references to mutable objects (like Date 
or a List), you must:

In the constructor: Create a deep copy of the passed-in mutable object and store the copy.

In getter methods: Return a deep copy of the mutable object, not the original reference. 
(This prevents external code from modifying the internal state via the returned reference.)
