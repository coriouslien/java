New Concurrency Utilities: Virtual Threads (Java 21)
Java 21 introduced Virtual Threads (Project Loom), a groundbreaking change to Java's concurrency 
model. They are lightweight threads implemented entirely within the JVM, designed to 
dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of high-throughput concurrent applications.

Platform Threads (Traditional): Heavyweight, OS-managed threads. Limited in number 
(often thousands max) due to memory and context-switching overhead.

Virtual Threads (New): Extremely lightweight threads that are scheduled by the JVM onto a 
small pool of carrier platform threads. You can create millions of them.

Benefit: Virtual Threads are cheap to create and block when waiting for I/O (like network 
or database calls), freeing up the underlying carrier thread to serve other virtual threads. 
This enables massive scalability for server applications with high concurrency demands.
